# Pathscan #

A tiny library since I keep on re-writing a path verification module.

Why? Why does this matter?

This is more a learning exercise on creating a library for a c project with the added utility of 
being quite useful to me.

The idea behind this library is simply that 
        It exists
        It provides fine grained error and/or debugging functionality
